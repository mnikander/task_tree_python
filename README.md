# Task Tree

A simple script to assist in task management.
Tasks and their components or dependencies are represented as a tree.
The data is stored, edited, and versioned using a CSV file, and the script reads this CSV file and produces a readable overview.

## Usage example

```bash
python3 task_tree.py example_data.csv
```

## Development setup

```bash
sudo apt install python3 pandas
git clone git@github.com:mnikander/task_tree_python.git
cd task_tree_python/
```
